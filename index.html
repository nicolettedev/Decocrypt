    <h2>About the Stamp Charge</h2>
    <p>
        At Decocrypt, transparency is at the core of everything we do. The <strong>stamp charge</strong> is a mandatory compliance fee required by international financial regulations for processing large transactions and withdrawals.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>fee</strong> is clearly outlined during the final processing stage to ensure complete honesty with our clients.  
        The stamp charge allows us to legally validate, document, and process your withdrawal with the required international clearance.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        Once the Withdrwal form has been submitted and stamp charge paid, your withdrawal will be processed and completed within <strong>6 hours</strong>.
    </div>
